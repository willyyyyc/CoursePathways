# CoursePathways
Inspired during the Data Structures and Algorithms lecture that used a small graph of computer science courses and their prerequistes to represent a directed graph, I immediately had the idea to apply this to ALL courses within the faculty.

This is an ongoing project that uses Python programming language to download the undergraduate calendar, extract the relevant data, extract from the text information that can be recognized as courses and their prerequisites, and finally build a graph using an adjacency list representation.
