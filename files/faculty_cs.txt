and Visualization.  
The Faculty of Computer Science was formed on April 1, 1997, following the amalgamation of the Technical University of Nova 
Scotia (TUNS) and Dalhousie University. Its members came from the School of Computer Science at TUNS and the Computing 
Science Division of the Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computing Science at Dalhousie.  
Significant growth has occurred in our format ive early years. Our graduate and undergraduate programs include imaginative multi -
disciplinary programs such as Electronic Commerce, Health Informatics, and Bioinformatics. The most up -to-date information on 
ongoing programs, ongoing curriculum revision, and general information about the Faculty can be found on our website:

be chosen from Dalhousie CSCI course offerings, and  
• of all CSCI credit hours required at the 3000 and 4000 level, at least half must be chosen from Dalhousie CSCI course 
offerings.  
In addition to the regulations below, please see the University's Academic Regulations  section.  
Workload  
A normal course load is five courses during each study term.  
Course Selection  
The content of every course that students take to meet degree requirements must represent new material: students may not take  courses 
whose content is largely repetitive of, or more elementary t han, a course taken earlier on the same topic, without permission of the 
Faculty.  
Of the 120 credit hours required to complete any CS undergraduate degree, at least 60 must be taken from Dalhousie University . 
Courses offered by the Faculty of Computer Scie nce may be cancelled due to low registration in accordance with the FCS Procedures

Double Majors and Combined Honours  
The following degree programs are available to students interested in interdisciplinary studies where the larger number of majors  
credits is Computer Science: Bachelor of Science (120 credit hours) with Double Major, Bachelor of Science (120 credit hours)  with 
Combined Honours, Bachelor of Arts (120 credit hours) Double Major and Bachelor of Arts (120 credit hours) Combined Honours.  
Combined Honours  
Students interested in taking honours in Computer Science and another subject as a combined program should consul t the honours 
advisor through whom a suitable course of study can be arranged.  
A combined honours program may well be an appropriate choice for many students. If a student is contemplating graduate work, it 
should be borne in mind that the work in either s ubject of a combined honours program may be insufficient for entry to a regular 
graduate program, and that a qualifying year may be necessary.  
Students who wish to arrange interdisciplinary programs (with fields such as Mathematics, Physics, Psychology, an d others) are 
invited to discuss their interests with the appropriate department and the Undergraduate Chair of the Faculty of Computer Sci ence.

Engineering as a Profession  
Engineering is an important profession. Virtually all aspects of modern life are involved with this fascinating discipline. E ngineering 
education at Dalhousie is demanding, because the engineering profession is demanding. Society expects its technical problem solvers 
to offer answers to some of the most difficult questions around, questions related to the environment, productivity, informat ion 
technology, communica tions, transportation, and more. In general, the engineering enterprise contributes not only to human welfare, 
but also to the sustainable development of our resources. Engineering education provides great rewards for the engineer of th e future. 
Specifical ly, there is the personal satisfaction of following a career where one ’s personal expertise can benefit fellow humans and 
contribute to the making of a better world.  
The Faculty of Engineering at Dalhousie University prepares its students with the problem -solving skills needed for lifelong 
exploration in a field that answers some of today ’s most pressing concerns. The Faculty of Engineering has an excellent tradition of 
providing engineering education for students in the Atlantic Provinces that started in 1 907 with the founding of the Nova Scotia 
Technical College. Our graduates occupy many important positions throughout Canada and in many other countries.  
The Faculty of Engineering offers undergraduate curricula leading to the degree of Bachelor of Engineer ing in the following 
disciplines:  
• Chemical Engineering  
• Civil Engineering  
• Electrical Engineering  
• Environmental Engineering  
• Industrial Engineering  
• Materials Engineering  
• Mechanical Engineering  
• Mineral Resource Engineering  
The Faculty also offers a Bachelor of Applied Science in Food Science (admission suspended, pending review), and post -graduate 
studies at the master ’s and doctoral level.  
For students who are eligible, the Faculty of Engineering offers a Bachelor of Engineering Co -operative Educati on program that 
integrates academic study with university approved industrial experience. Graduation from this program requires satisfactory 
performance in both areas. The schedule of study and work terms varies according to the discipline, details of whic h are outlined in 
Section E of the Engineering curricula in this calendar.  
The co -operative education system requires students to alternate periods of study with periods of university approved, full -time, paid 
employment. The period of employment is called  a work term and is normally four months (16 weeks) in length. Some programs 
combine two or more four month work terms. Work terms have academic requirements that must be completed in addition to the 
requirements of the employer.
