Course Descriptions
CSCI 1105 Introduction to Computer Programming
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course provides a general introduction to computer programming. The main focus is on programming skills and how to apply  these skills in solving a
variety of problems. Procedural programming concepts are stressed.
CALENDAR NOTES: Students who complete CSCI 1110 with a grade of C or greater BEFORE completing CSCI 1105 will not receive cre dit for taking
CSCI 1105.
EXCLUSIONS: INFX 1600X/Y.18,  CSCI 1100.03, grade C or higher in CSCI 1110.03


CSCI 1107 Social Computing
CREDIT HOURS: 3
A hands -on course on technologies and the underlying infrastructure for social computing, including digital collaboration media, soci al networks and
visualization , and their social impact. Students will use various applications, such as Twitter, YouTube, and wikis to examine their funct ionalities, and explore
infrastructure technologies including databases, computer networks and Web -servers that facilitate their ex ecution.


CSCI 1108 Introduction to Experimental Robotics
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course is an introduction to computing in the real world, experimental evaluation, and basic team work and project manag ement. These themes are
explored through the study of th e challenges and techniques for modeling, designing, and programming robotic systems to perfom complex tasks in a
changing and uncertain environment.
FORMATS: Lecture


CSCI 1109 Practical Data Science
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course will provide students wit h a practical overview of the world of data science research. Through hands -on use of Python â€™s data science libraries and
publicly open datasets students will be exposed to the research methods and cutting -edge analyses used to effectively manipulate, proc ess and investigate data
from diverse disciplines.
EXCLUSIONS: CSCI 2203.03


CSCI 1110 Introduction to Computer Science
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course provides a general introduction to computer science and the hardware and software of computers. The main f ocus is on programming skills and
how to apply these skills in solving a variety of problems. Algorithmic concepts, linear data structures are emphasized.
CALENDAR NOTES: This course assumes that the student has some programming experience.
EXCLUSIONS: CSC I 1101.03
FORMATS: Lecture
CSCI 4191 Application Development Project
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This is a project -oriented course for students to participate in distributed software development projects, such as the Undergraduate Capstone Open Source
Project (www.ucosp.ca) initiative. Students work as p art of a development team on new or existing projects for real -world applications. In this course students
learn how to work in large development teams, which may be geographically distributed. Students implement portions of a large  software project and gi ve a
public presentation on their work. Students work under supervision of a faculty member. A specific development project must b e approved by the
undergraduate chair in consultation with the instructor.
PREREQUISITES: (CSCI 3120.03, CSCI 3130.03 and CSCI  3171.03) or INFX 4600.03


CSCI 4192 Directed Studies
CREDIT HOURS: 3
This course is a study of specific academic subject area not covered in another course offered at Dalhousie University, under  close supervision of a faculty
member. It typically consist s of predetermined readings, discussions with the instructor, and a term paper summarizing the studied material. A specific
directed studies course must be approved by the undergraduate chair in consultation with the instructor.
PREREQUISITES: CSCI 3110.03 , CSCI 3120.03, CSCI 3130.03, (CSCI 3136.03 or CSCI 3137.03), CSCI 3171.03


CSCI 4193 Technology Innovation
CREDIT HOURS: 3
The Technology Innovation combines elements of design thinking, rapid prototyping, and software development that can be used to val idate ideas that could
yield new technologies and new business models. Over the semester students will work in interdisciplinary teams to address a Design Challenge posed by
industry. The ideas advanced by teams will reflect the powerful synergies that exi st between software development, design thinking and entrepreneurship.
PREREQUISITES: CSCI 2100.03, CSCI 2110.03, (CSCI 2132.03 or CSCI 2134.03), and CSCI 2141.03
